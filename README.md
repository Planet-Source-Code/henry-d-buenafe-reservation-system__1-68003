### Description

The program I made is an accomplishment of Information System student for there thesis they are the one who give me this project. I decided to help them and come up with this idea to give them a simple program using a simple code that is easy for them to analyst and understand the concept of visual basic programming.

I share this program to help other programmer develop and understand VB programming. This program is a sample of disconnected recordset. You can edit, delete, update, search and backup database.

I admit that some of my codes are from pscode. And to all pscode members who post there program I do salute you and hoping that someday somehow we can share each other about programming.
